# Simple-user-feedback-analyzer
This project is a simple feedback analyzer for a website, built using HTML and Flask. It includes two main files: feedback.html and app.py. The feedback.html file provides a basic frontend form where users can submit their feedback. The app.py file is a Python script that uses the Flask framework to handle the backend logic. When users submit their feedback through the form, the Flask app processes the input and can display or store the responses for further analysis. This project serves as a basic example of how to collect and handle user feedback using a lightweight web framework like Flask.
